# Green Stocks with VBA

## Overview of Project 
  Refactoring the orginal code. 
### Purpose
 The purpose of this projcect is refactoring the code in order to get an analysis of more datasets and to see if the VBA code can run through the loop of data faster.
### Background
 In the original code, we were able to analyze for a specific dataset, DQ Analysis, to find the yearly return. Then we added to the code, in order to analyze a dozen datasets and to find their yearly return. We also ran a timer to find out how long the code took to run.
## Results
 The original code, the run time was approzimately 0.81 seconds, in the refactored code, the run time was approximately 0.11 seconds.

 ## Summary

### Adavantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
  An advantage of refactoring the code is the run time of the script can be faster. Which if some had a large amounts of datasets, it would be helpful to be able to run through all of them in a short of amount of time. You could also use this code for different clients and whatever datasets they want analyzed, not just green stocks.  A disadvantage for this refactored code would be if you want a more detailed analysis.
### Advantages and disadvantages of the original & refactored VBA script
  An advantage of the original code would be able to see how the code is running through a specific dataset, which is also a disadvantge depending on what kind of information you need. Advantage to using the refactored VBA script is instead of changing each indivdual line of code to use for a certain dataset, you are able to change only one or two lines of code. Giving you a smaller chance of missing a line of code that needed to be changed.
